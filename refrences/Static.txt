//Static topic

//Declaration
public class Account{

	private int accno;        //instance data member , non-static data member , object level info
	private float balance;    //instance data member , non-static data member , object level info


	private static double int_rate;     //static data member , class level info 
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:-In construtor we should not initialized static data members.
Note:-Constructor main purpose is to initilized instance data members

 
public class Account{

	private int accno;        //instance data member , non-static data member , object level info
	private float balance;    //instance data member , non-static data member , object level info


	private static double int_rate;     //static data member , class level info 

	//static block -used to initialized static data member
	static{
	      int_rate=4.5;
	      }
	
	//default cons
	public Account()
	{
	
	}

	//para cons
	public Account(int a , float b)
	{
		this.accno=a;
		this.balance=b;
		//this.int_rate=i; //The static field Account.int_rate should be accessed in a static block
		// or we shoulc always initialized in static block
	}

}

Question:-When should static member gets initialized
Ans:-Constructor is used for initializing instance data members or static member get initialized before 1st object is created.


	//static block -used to initialized static data member
	static{         				//static block get initilized only static data members
	      int_rate=4.5;               		//non-static data member gets initilized within constructor
	      //accno=1;  //Cannot make a static reference to the non-static field accno
	      }						//static block gets called only once.
							//but constrctor may get called for every object creation.	

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:-When static block get executed
Ans:-Static block gets executed when Class is loaded in memory only once at first time.
Class will not be reloading. 
Class is already available in memory , beacuse class is a template,referring always differnt object.

Question:-






















Getter setter methods used in java
If we use private data members in our class then we used this getter and setter methods , 
without defining any constructor we use this intance members.

Array revise

Conditional and loops pdf share and some basic programs videos.
