		 The Print() Method
		There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().
		The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:
		 */
		System.out.print("Hello World! ");
		System.out.print("I will print on the same line.\n");
		/*
		 Print Numbers
		You can also use the println() method to print numbers.
		However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes:
		 */
		System.out.println(3);
		System.out.println(358);
		System.out.println(50000);
		//Forward slash(//)You can also perform mathematical calculations inside the println() method:
		System.out.println(3 + 3);
		System.out.println(2 * 5);
